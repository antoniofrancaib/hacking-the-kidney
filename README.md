# HuBMAP - Kidney Segmentation Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Segmenting Glomeruli Functional Tissue Units in Human Kidneys" project, part of the HuBMAP - Hacking the Kidney competition. This project aims to create a detailed map of the human kidney by identifying and characterizing functional tissue units (FTUs) in various tissue samples. The primary focus is on detecting glomeruli FTUs using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically U-Net.
